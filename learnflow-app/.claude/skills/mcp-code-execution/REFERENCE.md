# MCP Code Execution Reference

## Architecture
The mcp-code-execution skill provides a secure execution environment with:
- Container-based isolation
- Resource quota management
- Network security controls
- Execution monitoring and logging

## Security Model
The skill implements multiple security layers:
- Container runtime security
- Network isolation
- Resource limits to prevent abuse
- File system restrictions
- Process monitoring

## Execution Environment
Supports multiple runtimes:
- Python execution environment
- Node.js execution environment
- Go execution environment
- Java execution environment
